Its purpose: securely store sensitive mission data encoded in Morse code. But the system designers were… overconfident. A careless oversight in the input handling has left the device vulnerable to a classic format string flaw.\nYour mission is to retrieve the hidden flag. The flag is encoded in Morse code and stored in memory with no direct way to print it. Only by carefully exploiting the format string vulnerability can you reveal the encoded data. Once revealed, you must decode the Morse to complete your mission.\n",
